# Run-Zone
Run-Zone is a small browser based application, which can be used to track runs, hikes or just geolocations. 
If the user grants permission to access the device location, a new run can be tracked. The run is then saved within local storage, 
therefore the run is persisted even after browser restarts.
The application is deployed using *github-pages* an can be accessed under https://timwue.github.io/Run-Zone/.
